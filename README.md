## Training Profiles

| Profile | Model Files | Network Module | Bucket Step | Pipeline |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Anima** | DiT + Qwen3 + VAE | `networks.lora_anima` | 64px | sd-scripts |
| **SDXL / Pony / Illustrious** | checkpoint (+ optional VAE) | `networks.lora` | 32px | sd-scripts |
| **LTX 2.3** | checkpoint + Gemma encoder | `networks.lora_ltx2` | 16px | Musubi video |
| **Wan 2.2** | DiT + T5 + VAE | `networks.lora_wan` | 16px | Musubi video |
| **Krea 2** | RAW DiT + Qwen3-VL + Qwen-Image VAE | `networks.lora_krea2` | 32px | Musubi image |

**Auto Calc** reads your profile and dataset count, then picks rank, learning rates, batch size, gradient accumulation, steps, and save/sample intervals — all tuned to your available VRAM. It preserves your chosen optimizer (Prodigy stays at `lr=1.0` constant; AdamW/AdamW8bit stay at `1e-4` cosine).

---

## Dataset Layout

For **SDXL / Pony / Illustrious** and **Anima**, the dataset folder can hold subfolders, and each image can have two captions.

### Subfolders

Sort images into folders however you like. Every folder under the dataset path that contains images is trained.

```
my-dataset/
├── 1.png   1.txt
├── 2.png   2.txt
├── closeups/
│   ├── 1.png   1.txt
│   └── 2.png   2.txt
└── outfits/
    └── winter/
        └── 1.png   1.txt
```

- A caption belongs to the image with the same name **in the same folder**.
- Two things are skipped: the top-level `input/` folder, where Dataset Prep keeps your originals, and any folder whose name starts with a dot.
- Every folder is weighted the same. Folder names are only for your own sorting.
- **Tag** and **Resize** in Dataset Prep work through every folder. Resize moves each folder's originals to the same path under `input/` (for example `input/closeups/`) and writes the numbered copies back into the folder they came from.

Krea 2, LTX 2.3 and Wan 2.2 still read only the top folder.

### Two captions per image

Give an image a **`.txt`** and a **`.caption`** with the same name:

| File | What goes in it |
|------|-----------------|
| `1.txt` | Booru tags, as the tagger writes them. Required for every image. |
| `1.caption` | A natural-language description. Optional. |

An image with both trains **once with each caption**, so the model learns the concept from tags and from plain sentences. Your trigger word is added to both.

**Rules:**
- `.caption` works **per folder, all or nothing.** Training refuses to start if a folder has `.caption` files for some images but not others, and the error names the folder. Put images you only have tags for in their own folder.
- Put **one caption per file.** Don't write two lines into one `.txt` expecting both to be used: sd-scripts reads only the first line.
- The tagger does not write `.caption` files. Write them yourself or with a vision-language model.

**What changes under the hood:** each caption type becomes its own `[[datasets]]` block in the generated dataset TOML, with one subset per folder. sd-scripts keys images by file path, so the same image listed twice inside one block would keep only one of its captions. When `.caption` files are present, the text encoder cache is held **in memory** rather than written to disk, because the disk cache is one file per image and cannot hold two captions. All of this uses standard sd-scripts dataset options, so it keeps working when sd-scripts updates.

## Advanced

<details>
<summary><strong>Resume Training</strong></summary>

Three options in the Resume panel:
- **Resume training** enables state resume
- **Use latest saved state** auto-finds the newest state directory
- **Resume State Path** lets you pick a specific folder manually

All runs write state by default (`save_last_n_steps_state = 1`, `save_last_n_epochs_state = 1`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Textual Inversion</strong></summary>

Switch Training Mode to **Textual Inversion** to train text embeddings instead of LoRAs. Configure:
- Placeholder token (default `*test*`)
- Number of vectors (default 16)
- Initializer word
- Learning rate (auto-scaled by vector count)
- Batch size (VRAM-aware)
- Random cropping toggle

Supported for Anima and SDXL/Pony/Illustrious profiles.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Anima LoRA Metadata</strong></summary>

New LoRA files include Anima safetensors metadata. Inspect or repair existing LoRAs:

```bash
python training/sd-scripts/tools/anima_lora_metadata.py path/to/lora.safetensors
python training/sd-scripts/tools/anima_lora_metadata.py path/to/lora.safetensors --fix
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Required Models</strong></summary>

Use the Runtime Tool (**Download Models**) to fetch base files:

```
models/anima/dit/anima-base-v1.0.safetensors
models/anima/text_encoder/qwen_3_06b_base.safetensors
models/anima/vae/qwen_image_vae.safetensors
```

Use **Download Prep** for dataset-prep models:

```
models/wd-eva02-large-tagger-v3/    (WD EVA02 tagger)
models/u2net/u2net.onnx             (U2Net background removal)
```

Or install manually:
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/SmilingWolf/wd-eva02-large-tagger-v3 models/wd-eva02-large-tagger-v3
curl -L -o models/u2net/u2net.onnx https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/download/v0.0.0/u2net.onnx
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>torch.compile (Anima)</strong></summary>

Per-block DiT compilation for faster Anima training. Configurable mode, backend (inductor), dynamic shape handling, and cache size. Requires Triton — automatically disabled when ROCm or custom PyTorch backends are selected. On Windows with dynamic shapes, requires MSVC Build Tools environment.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>ROCm and Custom PyTorch Note</strong></summary>

CUDA remains the fully supported default. ROCm 6.4 and existing-PyTorch modes are experimental — they disable CUDA-only features (Flash Attention, torch.compile/Triton) automatically. AMD GPU monitoring on Linux works via kernel sysfs and does not require ROCm installed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>H2D-only Musubi Block Swap</strong></summary>

LTX 2.3, Wan 2.2, and Krea 2 LoRA profiles use Musubi's H2D-only block swap by default when block swap is enabled. The frozen base weights keep a master copy in CPU RAM, so only host-to-device transfers are needed; the redundant device-to-host copy used by classic block swap is skipped. This is especially useful with FP8 base/scaled weights.

The Advanced Musubi dialog exposes **H2D-only block swap (LoRA)** and **H2D ring buffers**. The default ring size is `2` for transfer/compute overlap; select `1` to minimize VRAM at the cost of that overlap.

Requirements and limits:
- CUDA and frozen-base LoRA / LoHa / LoKr training only; it is not compatible with full base-model fine-tuning.
- Gradient checkpointing is required and is enabled by the Musubi profile defaults.
- Do not combine it with LTX 2 aggressive block-swap modes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Adding New Training Types</strong></summary>

Future types should use small profile adapters rather than UI/backend branches. See `docs/training-type-integration.md` for the full checklist.

Short version: add an architecture constant and profile case, Musubi command builder, TOML generation, colored UI button, and focused tests.

Note: upstream Musubi source is `https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner`. The LTX 2.3 integration depends on LTX2 entrypoints that may live in an LTX-capable fork — preserve those files when updating vendored Musubi.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>System Requirements</strong></summary>

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| **GPU** | NVIDIA (CUDA) recommended; AMD (ROCm 6.4) on Linux |
| **Python 3.12** | Recommended for the embedded runtime |
| **nvidia-smi** | Needed for NVIDIA GPU monitoring |
| **amdgpu kernel driver** | Needed for AMD GPU monitoring on Linux |
| **Go 1.22+** | Only when building from source |

## Container (Docker / Podman)

You can run the whole app in a container. It behaves the same on Docker and
on Podman — `scripts/run.sh` detects which engine you have and sets the right
GPU flags automatically.

**First start** installs the Python training stack (Python 3.12 + PyTorch +
trainer dependencies) into the `trainflow_tf` volume. That takes about
5–10 minutes and uses ~8 GB. **Every start after that is fast.**

### 1. Build and start

The first time, build the image **and** start the app in one command:

```bash
TRAINFLOW_BUILD=1 ./scripts/run.sh
```

- **First start** has no runtime volume yet, so it runs in the foreground
  and shows the one-time bootstrap as it happens. Let it finish.
- **Every later start** just runs the app in the background — the image is
  already built and the volume already exists:

```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```

(If you ever need to rebuild the image on its own without starting the app,
run `podman build --format docker -t dasiwa/trainflow:latest .` — or
`docker build -t dasiwa/trainflow:latest .` on a Docker host.)

When it is up, open the UI at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.

### 2. Where your files go

The container looks for your data next to the project folder:

```
datasets/     # your image / video datasets
models/       # base model files (DiT, VAE, text encoders, ...)
```

Both folders are created automatically if they do not exist yet.
In the UI, choose paths under `/app/datasets/...` and `/app/models/...`.

**Datasets live on your machine, not in the container.** Both folders are
bind-mounted in, so everything you put in `datasets/` or `models/` stays on
the host, is visible from both sides, and is safe across container restarts,
image rebuilds, and even `volume rm trainflow_tf` (the volume only holds the
Python runtime and app state — never your data).

To keep your data in a different place, point `DATASETS_DIR` (and
`MODELS_DIR`) at it — works for both `scripts/run.sh` and compose:

```bash
DATASETS_DIR=/path/to/datasets ./scripts/run.sh
DATASETS_DIR=/path/to/datasets podman compose up -d
```

Model files (~20 GB) can be downloaded through the Runtime Tool (step 3) or
copied over from a normal, non-container install.

One exception: **training results** (the project output folder) are written
inside the container to `/app/training/output/<project>` — that lives in the
`trainflow_tf` volume, not on your machine. To grab a finished LoRA, copy it
out of the volume (e.g. `podman cp trainflow:/app/training/output/<project> .`).

### 3. Runtime Tool (optional)

The Runtime Tool is where you install or update the Python runtime and where
you download model files. It shares the same volume as the main app, so you
start it with compose:

```bash
# use whichever engine you have — podman or docker:
podman compose up -d trainflow-tool
```

It opens at `http://127.0.0.1:7871`. When you are done:

```bash
podman compose stop trainflow-tool
```

### Good to know

- **GPU.** `scripts/run.sh` passes the GPU to the container for you —
  Docker uses `--gpus all`, Podman uses the host's NVIDIA CDI
  (`--device nvidia.com/gpu=all`). Training only uses GPU 0.
  For AMD ROCm instead: add `--device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri` and set
  `TORCH_BACKEND=rocm`.
- **GPU tiles in the UI.** The launcher bind-mounts the host's `nvidia-smi`
  so the live GPU tiles work. If it is missing, training still runs — the
  GPU tiles just stay empty.
- **Update the app.** Rebuild the image: `TRAINFLOW_BUILD=1 ./scripts/run.sh`.
- **Start over from scratch.** Delete the runtime volume to force a
  re-bootstrap: `podman volume rm trainflow_tf` (or `docker volume rm trainflow_tf`).

<summary><strong>Shipping & Distribution</strong></summary>

Do not commit `python_embeded/` to Git.

**Normal distribution** — ship only the root binaries; the runtime tool creates the platform runtime on the user's machine:
- Windows: `TrainFlow.exe` + `TrainFlow_Runtime_Tool.exe`
- Linux: `TrainFlow` + `TrainFlow_Runtime_Tool`

**Fully offline packages** — create a ZIP/7z containing binaries plus `python_embeded/<platform>` and upload as a GitHub Release asset.
